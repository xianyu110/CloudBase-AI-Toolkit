# CloudBase MCP

Open source:

- GitHub: https://github.com/TencentCloudBase/CloudBase-AI-ToolKit
- Domestic mirror: https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/CloudBase-AI-ToolKit

The server source is `mcp/` in that repo. The package name is `@cloudbase/cloudbase-mcp`.

## Sibling skills (local only)

Sibling CloudBase skills ship beside this skill. Use local relative paths such as `../cloudbase-cli/SKILL.md`.

If a referenced sibling skill file is missing from this environment, ask the user to install the full CloudBase plugin (or the missing skill). Do **not** HTTP-fetch remote skill or protocol markdown into the agent context.

- MCP setup, mcporter commands, and auth examples: `../cloudbase/references/mcp-setup.md`
- CLI fallback when MCP tools are not loaded: `../cloudbase-cli/SKILL.md`
- MCP vs CLI decision tree: `../cloudbase/references/tooling-fallback.md`

## When to use

- The user is connecting MCP, or choosing local versus remote.
- The user or the agent calls CloudBase tools from the shell with mcporter, or needs a tool schema before calling.
- The user needs the site, region, cloud-mode, or plugin switches that already exist.
- A bug is in this repo's MCP server, skills, or CLI, and the fix should be a pull request.

## Do not use this for

- Creating or changing cloud resources. Use the matching domain skill, or `../cloudbase-cli/SKILL.md` when MCP tools are not loaded.
- Cloud platform, permission, or account problems that are not code in this repo. Those go to an issue, not a pull request.

## Connection

| Mode | Address |
|------|---------|
| Remote, domestic | `https://tcb-api.cloud.tencent.com/mcp/v1` |
| Remote, international | `https://tcb-api.tencentcloud.com/mcp/v1` |
| Local | `npx @cloudbase/cloudbase-mcp@latest` (Node.js 18.15+) |

The hostname decides the site. Remote URLs do not take a `site` query parameter.

- Interactive clients: put only the URL in the IDE config. The IDE opens a browser for login. This is the usual path.
- CI: add `env_id` and headers `X-TencentCloud-SecretId` / `X-TencentCloud-SecretKey`.
- Local stdio for the international site: `TCB_SITE=intl` and `TCB_REGION=ap-singapore`.

Remote mode cannot upload local files or download templates. The international site does not expose NoSQL tools.

## Calling tools with mcporter

When this session has no native MCP tools, use mcporter. The command list and the auth examples live in `../cloudbase/references/mcp-setup.md`. Read that file before login, environment binding, or `manageEnv`.

Check whether the server is configured:

```bash
npx mcporter list | grep cloudbase
```

If it is missing, add a stdio server named `cloudbase` in `config/mcporter.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudbase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@cloudbase/cloudbase-mcp@latest"],
      "description": "CloudBase MCP",
      "lifecycle": "keep-alive"
    }
  }
}
```

Read the schema before the first call. `describe` without `--all-parameters` omits parameters.

```bash
npx mcporter describe cloudbase --all-parameters
npx mcporter list cloudbase --schema
```

Call a tool with `server.tool` and `key=value` arguments:

```bash
npx mcporter call cloudbase.queryEnv action=list --output json
```

Do not put a Secret ID, Secret Key, or environment ID into `mcporter.json`. Login stays on `cloudbase.auth` or `tcb login`, as written in `mcp-setup.md`.

## Environment

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `TCB_SITE` | `domestic` or `intl`. `ap-singapore` exists on both sites; a domestic Singapore environment must set `TCB_SITE=domestic`. |
| `TCB_REGION` | API region, such as `ap-shanghai` or `ap-singapore`. |
| `CLOUDBASE_MCP_CLOUD_MODE` or `MCP_CLOUD_MODE` | `true` disables local file and process tools for a self-hosted caller. |
| `CLOUDBASE_MCP_PLUGINS_ENABLED` / `CLOUDBASE_MCP_PLUGINS_DISABLED` | Comma-separated plugin names for a local server. |
| `enable_plugins` / `disable_plugins` | The same switch on a remote URL, comma-separated. |

Plugin names are the ones in `mcp/src/server.ts` (`env`, `database`, `functions`, `hosting`, `storage`, and the rest). A local server and a hosted remote server enable the same default set; turn one off for a given caller with `disable_plugins` on the remote URL or `CLOUDBASE_MCP_PLUGINS_DISABLED` on a local server.

## Contributing

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the repo root. Fork, use a feature branch, and follow the commit types listed there (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, and the rest). Install with corepack and `pnpm install`.

- A bug in MCP, a skill, or the CLI: open a pull request.
- The cloud platform, a permission, or the account: open an issue. Do not put an environment ID or a secret in the text.
- `prepareFeedback` only returns the new-issue page for the current site. Write the text in the chat. The user logs in and submits it.
